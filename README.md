# Real-Time-Emotion-Recognition-Through-Live-Camera.

## Project Description
This project implements an Automatic Facial Expression Recognition (FER) system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The system is designed to detect and classify emotions in real-time from facial expressions captured through a live camera feed.

## Key Features:
Emotion Classification: Identifies emotions such as happiness, sadness, surprise, anger, and neutrality.
Real-time Processing: Analyzes emotions from live camera feeds in real-time.
Feedback System: Provides tailored content (e.g., guided meditations, motivational quotes) based on detected emotions.
CNN Architecture: Utilizes state-of-the-art Convolutional Neural Networks for accurate emotion recognition.
## Significance
This project contributes to advancements in:

Human-computer interaction
Psychological research
Potential clinical diagnostics
By focusing on non-verbal communication cues, particularly facial expressions, this system aims to bridge the gap in understanding human emotions, which play a crucial role in effective communication.

## Technologies Used
Python
TensorFlow/Keras (for CNN implementation)
OpenCV (for image processing and camera integration)
Keras(for building and training the Convolutional Neural Network(CNN))
